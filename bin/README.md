CS 3330 Final Project
Group AA
Colin Buchheit, Kymani Scott, Drew Distler and Connor Joyce

We are going to create a hotel system that will provide the user with a variety of different functions. It will act as an application that a customer will have access to while reserving a room and during their stay. They will be able to request all things associated with staying at a hotel through this application. This could potentially do the job of the front desk. They will be able to check into their room, check out, pay their bills, upgrade their rooms and handle many other features all dealing with their stay at the hotel.
